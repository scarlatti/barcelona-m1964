# A Typographical Facsimile of Scarlatti's Barcelona MS. 1964 Manuscript

This repository contains the Sibelius source and PDF sheet music of a **typographical facsmile**
of the Barcelona MS 1964 manuscript containing Domenico Scarlatti sonatas.

## Credits

The creation of this digital edition was overseen by Sir Barry Ife (@BarryIfe).

## Contents

This repository contains three folders:

- `pdf` contains the sheet music of the typographical facsimile, one file per sonata;
- `src` contains the Sibelius source for each of the sonatas contained in `pdf`;
- `tables` contains two collation tables that show how the sonatas in the Barcelona MS. 1964 manuscript relate to other sources (historical and modern); these tables are available in both Word (`.doc`) and PDF format.

## Inventory of the typographical facsimile

The manuscript contains 44 sonatas, however the last 5 sonatas are of verified attribution to Antonio Soler, and have not been reproduced in this typographical facsimile. Therefore this typographical facsimile contains 39 sonatas.

The 31st and 34th sonatas do not appear in the Kirkpatrick catalog. Neither are currently believed to be by Domenico Scarlatti, except for the debated attribution by Malcolm Boyd (_Domenico Scarlatti— Master of Music_, 1987) of the Sonata in E major. The manuscript copyist certainly believed both sonatas to be by Domenico Scarlatti, as in the original manuscript, the 39th sonata comes with the mention _Finis de las sonatas de Scarlati_, which seems to demarcate a Scarlatti section (1–39) and a Soler section (40–44).
